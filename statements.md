1. Problem Statement

Traditional computer systems cannot automatically identify objects in images without manual tagging or human involvement. This limits automation in applications such as security systems, inventory monitoring, and smart assistants. The project aims to implement an AI-based object detection system using the YOLO model that can detect multiple objects in an image with high accuracy and speed. The system processes an input image and outputs the detected objects along with their labels and confidence scores.

2. Scope of the Project

The project covers object detection using a pre-trained YOLO model.

It focuses on detecting common objects in static images.

The scope includes loading the model, processing input images, detecting objects, and displaying results.

The project does not include custom training, dataset creation, or real-time tracking.

Future upgrades may include video detection, custom datasets, and integration into applications.

3. Target Users

Students learning artificial intelligence, machine learning, or computer vision.

Developers exploring object detection systems.

Beginners who want a simple project demonstrating AI involvement.

Educators who need a clear example of an AI-based Python implementation.

4. High-Level Features

Loads pre-trained YOLO model for object detection.

Accepts any image from the user for processing.

Detects multiple objects in a single image with confidence scores.

Displays bounding boxes, labels, and confidence percentages.

Simple and easy-to-run Python script without complex setup.

Uses OpenCV and YOLO, two widely used tools in computer vision.
